## Clean Architecture
I decided to follow **Clean Architecture** to keep the app well-structured, easy to test, and scalable in the long run. Each layer has a clear responsibility ‚Äî which really helped me stay organized.

- **Domain:** Contains the core business models and logic.

- **Application:** Manages use cases that coordinate domain logic.

- **Infrastructure:** Deals with external systems like API requests.

- **Presentation (UI):** Built with React, this layer handles everything the user interacts with.


##  Clean Code Approach
I made a conscious effort to follow clean code principles to ensure the code is easy to read, maintain, and extend. I believe that well-written code should speak for itself, so I focused on making it clear and intuitive, minimizing the need for comments. I spent time ensuring that variables and functions have names that clearly describe their purpose, which helps anyone reading the code understand what‚Äôs happening right away.

This approach ensures that anyone reviewing or extending the project can quickly understand the logic and confidently make changes without confusion.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Test core logic such as authentication services and URL operations using **Jest**.

- **End-to-End Tests**: Use **Cypress** to simulate real user journeys and ensure the app works as expected from the UI perspective.
