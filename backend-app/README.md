# URL Shortener Backend

This is the backend for the URL Shortener application, built with **Node.js** and **Express**. It provides RESTful APIs for:
- User authentication (JWT)

- URL creation, listing, deletion

- User management (admin only)

- App search via Google Custom Search

- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas


The code follows **Clean Architecture** and **Clean Code principles**, is fully **tested** with Jest & Supertest, documented with **Swagger**, and ready to run in **Docker**.

## Features
- üîê Authentication: Register, login, logout with JWT tokens.

- üîó URL Management: Create, list, delete shortened URLs.

- üë§ User Management: Admin-only routes to list, update, delete users.

- üîç App Search: Search any app by name using Google Custom Search.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Validation & Error Handling: Joi for request validation; consistent error responses.

- üê≥ Dockerized: Easily build and run via Docker & Docker Compose.

## Clean Architecture
I decided to follow **Clean Architecture** to keep the app well-structured, easy to test, and scalable in the long run. Each layer has a clear responsibility ‚Äî which really helped me stay organized.

- **domain**  
  Defines the core business models (`User`, `Url`, etc.) and interfaces (e.g. `IUserRepository`) with **no external dependencies**.

- **usecases**  
  Implements each application operation (login, createUrl, listUsers, etc.) by orchestrating domain models and repository interfaces.

- **infrastructure**  
  Provides concrete implementations of domain interfaces: Mongoose/ MongoDB repositories, Axios wrappers, Google Search integration.

- **interface**  
  Contains Express controllers, route definitions and Joi schemas to adapt HTTP requests/responses to the use‚Äêcase layer.


##  Clean Code Approach
I made a conscious effort to follow clean code principles to ensure the code is easy to read, maintain, and extend. I believe that well-written code should speak for itself, so I focused on making it clear and intuitive, minimizing the need for comments. I spent time ensuring that variables and functions have names that clearly describe their purpose, which helps anyone reading the code understand what‚Äôs happening right away.

This approach ensures that anyone reviewing or extending the project can quickly understand the logic and confidently make changes without confusion.

## API Documentation (Swagger)
Visit **/api-docs** after starting the server to explore and try out all routes.


## Testing
- **Unit Tests (Jest)**: Test individual modules (services, utils).

- **Integration Tests (Supertest)**: pin up an in-memory MongoDB to test API endpoints end-to-end.
